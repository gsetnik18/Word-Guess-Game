# Word-Guess-Game
Repo for homework 3: harder version
Player types a letter to start. If that letter exists in the word randomly chosen from the array, it will replace all instances of that letter in the word, which is displayed as blanks. If the letter is not in the word, it will be stored under wrong guesses. After 10 wrong guesses, player had better be ready...but if the player manages to guess the movie title, their win will be stored under the word, and a new word will be chosen.
